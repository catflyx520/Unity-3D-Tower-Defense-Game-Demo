# Unity-3D-Tower-Defense-Game-Demo

#### TD game is always been my favorite.
Using Unity 3D to create a tower defense game demo. The game started as an incremental game where player has to click to get coin to unlock feature until it transits into to a tower defense game. It demonstrated a transition of dynamics and merchanics of the game. 
The code is written with C# and all the C# scripts are in the Assets->Scripts folder. 
Since this game is a demo, so there are a lot of improvements can be made and bugs need to fix. 
The game is done by following the tutorial of the brilliant YouTuber Brackeys. Big thanks!
A project of me and my teammate Anvita Warty.
