#### TD game is always been my favorite.
Using Unity 3D to create a tower defense game demo. The game started as an incremental game where player has to click to get coin to unlock feature until it transits into to a tower defense game. It demonstrated a transition of dynamics and merchanics of the game. <br>
The code is written with C# and all the C# scripts are in the Assets->Scripts folder. <br>
The difficult part of this project is understand and connects all different systems together such as reward system, building system, fire system, and collison system.<br>
I also learn that balancing, testing, and debuging are extremely essential for a game. I have to keep adjust enemy speed, health, span rate, and enemy quantities, so the game can finish in a reasonable speed and difficulty. <br>
Since this game is a demo, so there are a lot of improvements can be made and bugs need to fix. <br>
The game is done by following the tutorial of the brilliant YouTuber Brackeys. Big thanks!<br>
A project of me and my teammate Anvita Warty.<br>
